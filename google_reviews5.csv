Enjoyed a wonderful evening at Fire.

Service was top notch in the bar and at our table.

Food was beautifully cooked and presentation was superb.

We opted for the 3 course set menu which offered really good value all round. Some of the dishes carry a supplement (the prawns amd the rib eye steak) but they are worth choosing if you like these!

If you like cauliflower then the side order of cauliflower is a must!!

Two cocktails were equally beautiful.

We sat on the terrace and the view of Dawson St as the evening closed in was wonderful.

We look forward to our next visit soon!

Service: Our waiters were attentive and nice, and they gave us some good recommendations from the menu.

Food: We ordered the chicken caesar salad, Connemara rock oysters, prime sirloin center cut, wood-fired tiger prawns, chocolate fromboise, and Irish cheeseboard. All of them were delicious and served fresh, and the portions were big! The oysters were particularly excellent.

Drinks: We got the Noperol Spritz and Mango Caipirinha. They were both refreshing and a great complement to the meal.

The ambience is excellent and food is outstanding 👌 when you enter you are taken care in a very royal way. The waiters are very professional and take outstanding care of all the guests 😀 For vegetarian people also there are 2 steaks available cauliflower and beet steak. I prefer cauliflower steak and it was just delicious 😋. They have a 60 euro 3 course meal dinner menu which is amazing. The breads 🍞 served are remarkable and butter they give is just out of the world 🌎. There is also an piano 🎹 at entrance and they have 2 bar ine at bottom floor and one at upper floor. They also have party halls with capacity of 14 people with complete privacy and excellent seating 💺 for birthdays, corporate parties and events. The staff is extremely polite and always does their best to make you happy 😊. If you or your friend has birthday they also give a small pastry with happy birthday written on the plate. At upper floor there are 2 seating areas one is inside and one is outside with heaters. I prefer outside area more and it was amazing experience. All my friends have said this was the best steak they had in their life till now. They also have a early bird menu where in 35 euro there is 2 course meal and in 40 euro there is 3 course meal. This is a must visit place in dublin and food is exceptionally great.

The three course meal is well worth the price, and the food is beyond exceptional. However, service could be improved as you shouldn’t have to wave to order at such an expensive restaurant nor should dirty dishes pile up during the dining experience.

That's the first thing I have to say if anyone ask me what do I think about this restaurant.

First of all, I love meat and second, I love a good place that serves a nice steak, wine and good food combo, like the poached egg they offer as a steak's side 👌🏽 Delicious! 😋

I got a beautiful rib-eye with a side of poached egg and I know it's crazy, but the egg yolk goes very well with potatoes and steak, that's why in Chile we have chorrillanas ❤️

Anyway, I've been wanting to go to Fire for a good while. Whenever I parked in town or walked by Dawson street, I smelled that beautiful fired coal or wood mixed with the meat. It's amazing.

I'm happy I finally went and I'm planning my next time after my son is born because my wife can't enjoy a well done steak 🥩
It's gonna be her postpartum celebration 🎉

Lovely place. Super recommended.
Write me a DM on Insta if you didn't like it because I couldn't agree with that 😂

Atmosphere is great! Fancy place, lovely cocktails and I like the idea of a welcoming area/bar before you go to your table. I think it makes the difference and it reminds me all the resorts I've been. Just love it.

Well done, guys!",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv3yBEBxUeMsLUHk6Fl5gKf9o3jRtpWrp2AXTd,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv3yBEBxUeMsLUHk6Fl5gKf9o3jRtpWrp2AXTd, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmsBKxGERU6TUUx4FOcZI4j9tufD-AYQsrlptS, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWV7h_UNR8-7KMQ2C2ahkbcPjgMlQJ7Yw_cQRc, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIh_S21dDKOCS8D4GSZpkomC1yGWCdQk3isc-J, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE7a0LoCMze5A320ph789nqraVDo3k0LrNSPZ2, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMVNzpyezc1ZdMv1BL2Fyzq3I3UBw7xMN-_Obj, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcZJ1Q3Cf8SQf6uESQD2EzWoAs0WPtsODZkGwT, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBMb3jMUZ-2Tg83iLdzMx1ZW4iIwH2Z9aPKrim, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMok3vWn1SWyue-T1xkiefkmz3w6J8PUr9OsYzG, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNol3QbaqsuYLy2GaWyAYLZ0C7f7b7oPPisfLOm, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOB5AN1yf00lbDYN8o4bYlTijy1JHNPbpI9s4V8, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYXvRpM97kvV9RMEaN6BQ7F5chRnbCIfMBa6uZ, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLsCVRr8gRuEpuf-ashhr6Bcg7UkqcQ6NVxD3c, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5leR3htii_jdGTrmXH64cvq--A6dp69wQ34a4, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOquiWbuRMFKBSLQbgP6ekMNgn2IIrf73SsgwrZ, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9aYh1vxhByKlZodtykTAb9aK7ffDBUIG0r1G4, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSs5-C9JdevFjpWufCQF21jOc5n9w0mH2YASHJ, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl72oUNTAmooGscjFCYBgkauzylcXcMIVmZu5r, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmmLSIrdLO360X6pCQQWCBGAp2cM07Trh-py4S, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8zURw_6b5hX3eB3ObBQSp8HH8-mz090fHsWtM, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPRVuMXnSLoAcLcFDrjt2sEsbqFoVo-EtUcuNb, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIzAi5zoyf_IYUa8DbZVe2kdob2QXR6vdvb08G",,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOXFXZmFBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xa78bc9f5604e6175!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-9qWfaA%7CCgwIjcaYnAYQkPWO7gI%7C?hl=en-US,5,1669735181,11/29/2022 15:19:41,2,-6.37378E+18

We booked an outdoor table, there were other 2 tables at that time (so not too busy), waiters/waitresses who served our table were nice (especially the man in suit, i guess he's the manager),  but they got my drink wrong, and i also had to remind them 2 times for my coke to be served. Food is great but the display is somehow not met my expectation. What upset me the most was  when we left I said thank you and bye to the same lady at the reception but she did not response. Nice food but i will not come back!

Giving 4 star because of very loud music which made it difficult to talk to my friends.,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO3Pb2954f_K06iaUA51QaKrTGKNtryMm4G-ft,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO3Pb2954f_K06iaUA51QaKrTGKNtryMm4G-ft, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0JH2Z81qKnceNyzzdpwe3NtX0RLHtg8hdvy5f, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx-AxUPa6dDiM7wBgQasK-tNa1ZTElHCo_Dzbr, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWREvl4QQemV9GZpuE_c-P_zXGLqvR87nMIY8f, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD52ixKjJL38KVz6NL41bYaQmKVz76qdvy3pP_, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDRC8VBXLyPjKCnB1LResUZmu7Fhoc7r2TWEHa, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg3jxD83aAoKw9K205Ia0IL_A0dUa3WqHi2nPV, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAuE_C9wZsOKDPqJ91A_R14sctu6QGTqEUIiv4, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVPKuNe2lraKxv9jlPKgaAfwfmBd4JqTbJNgA6, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO84YiZcbIYzkTsfS83CkolqG7AxW8MEHYF2zUP, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOSmbDw74iCjWEZBeXUen5Oyi8O0zo0Y61gYav, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2MaJITGg6k7O74k4VMfY_enLtCbS5Ra2VibpS, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMrnNKLegowSOLDZVea3aRU4dGRN3c5i07mMRj, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOve7L-R8pDhBG8LrwVw3bxvsgMNkLF0v_qvwAe, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ0P6VpL6tox65rWPQU5o0ZsrWIp8mhcZ3WQ79, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm7ypcvPCawAGXyxXOQ8LI-F_6EeLDlfsvcDU2, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ20zJxabVwPlLvoh0f24VjDqFun7Yoja3Q4vn, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzp3aplnfowYCo18rT7Qm6XspkCOfhnf_lbnWv, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvpJ-ycdoNyXLY4-lZCxvoT1tYeKlEjIRqY8z2, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBUvhvTd_3K_Xe9A7eR4ZC0s-VW4lQK7wxglHw, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX-ECgwgptilHDhtPRQ2q_pHd4vN9w-qoS8nYx, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbfQea7gFpFJFkdZwSgfqDgNgyABF8W4h90JXh, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSB41M_Az_XWykjquCjYetKkGlTwmqMDMbJug1, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLPaZQoLDAPVA5qk3fCzhyduJ3Xk9Kq-Tz955Z",,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR4MmRxanhRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x18c5513ffc110c62!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDx2dqjxQE%7CCgwIupyXpAYQ8KC72gE%7C?hl=en-US,4,1686490682,06/11/2023 13:38,0,1.78492E+18

What shocked me was that our entrees arrived at the table even before our drinks (at least 5+ minutes, yes we waited along time). Secondly, he didn’t come back to tell us they were out of burrata. Maybe he thought because he said they might be out that was enough. I don’t know, but he didn’t even come back to tell us or ask if we wanted something else. The margarita pizzas we ordered were mediocre at best. Lastly, I had to go to the bar counter to get a second round of drinks and for water.

I appreciate there response! 💕
———

Last night I arrived with a group of my friends for a 32nd birthday drinks booking. WE WERE ALL REFUSED ENTRY.

The bouncer said “we did not fit in with the dress code “. In the meantime the same bouncers ignored us and allowed others who wore jeans and trainers 👟 into the venue.
I was so disgusted as now it was apparent that the dress code NO BLACKS ALLOWED!

My friends and I were upset and embarrassed about this display in front of others but as God would have it, complete strangers of caucasian 👩‍💼 skin colour stood for us and argued with the bouncer’s for discrimination! Other guest’s who had been given entrance during this came back outside and demanded to know why we were being treated this way. The bouncer told our heroes to mind there own business.

To the amazing brave women and men From last night, God bless you! Thank you 🙏 so much for the love 💕, support.

To Nolita however, I was really disappointed and saddened by my experience at your establishment. It was humiliating and embarrassing to have been treated this way by your staff on account of upholding your standards.

Advice! If your staff at your door do not represent your values as a company, then they shouldn’t be there. Because now you left us and others with a bad view of Nolita, which may not reflect your true business.
With that being said, you retaining the same security staff at the door 🚪 after this nightmare would be a clear indication of your values.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0lI4UXLchRuGbCzcQa-1cjE7I5eVAIfPzHSkV,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0lI4UXLchRuGbCzcQa-1cjE7I5eVAIfPzHSkV, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQLSVDBLesDxbmp4V2H6Od_97fUyuxH3K_uyfe",,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNi1lcWJ3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x18c5513ffc110c62!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDB6-eqbw%7CCgsI3eHengYQ-LPGJA%7C?hl=en-US,2,1675079901,01/30/2023 11:58:21,7,1.78492E+18

We had booked in advance but when we arrived the doorman outside was brash and unwelcoming, stopping us entry. We said we had booking for 7.30 (arriving on time) and eventually let us in.
Inside the door wasn’t much better. The maître D arrived with his tablet rudely snapping if we had booked and after more grumbling from him he eventually found our booking and led us to our table.  Not a great start!!
The food choice was good.  The meal was reasonably good and not too costly for what we had. The service at the table was poor and slow. We were not offered the dessert menu after our mains - instead the bill was brought to us before we asked for it, and told we had to move from our seats!

Great cocktail selection. We had a gin raspberry thing and a vodka elderflower thing. Both great!

Food
Our server John told us all the pasta was homemade - pumpkin ravioli was a buttery sensation. Also had the market fish (bake with gnocchi and broccoli) which was moreish. Fish was crispy and satisfying! Parmesan and pancetta fries. are a must!

Atmosphere
Playing nice space age music - We believe it was caribou! Our server recommended we come back on the weekend for the saxophone and clubbing. We… may.

Service
John was attentive, relaxed and charming. Would recommend.

Good for dates or nights with with the gals!

Both managers were very rude and dismissed our complaint, when asked their name the manager replied ‘I don’t give a s***’ I do not have to give my name to you’ and walked off. We told them that staff did not ask and check if we needed any other drinks or how the food was.

Disappointed how the receptionist treated us, we asked to speak to the restaurant manager (the one with the blonde hair). However, the restaurant manager was very cold and stern in his approach. For example, we told the manager no one had checked on our meals once it was served but the manager kept repeatedly saying that they only ask that question once all the meal was finished - which we all found quite odd.

We’re extremely disappointed how the manager handled the situation. especially when they threatened to call the police because we didn’t want to pay the bill for the poor service.

I want to point out about Ben and his hosting services were impeccable and I loved his Gucci tie and Bow tie change the next day! Manager Diago was extremely helpful and got my cocktails at the bar really quickly so as a customer, with a busy bar area, he was able to manage the customer service with a smile and also a very nice double breast suit jacket. There are some Strong Skilled Female Cocktail creators too and I want to note they were super friendly and need to be acknowledged! Lucas for Argentina thank you for being friendly, although not my server he was engaging and I love the international vibes here.

I have to ENCOURAGE bringing CASH for tipping the staff. I will say everyone and the service and food is just amazing however I want to know the staff are being tipped for their work and that they don't have any troubles keeping their tips. I carry cash and got my waiter Fortis to give me some change and was able to tip him directly.

Fortis (Greek) was fun with my friends and was able to serve the table with ease. He took photos for us and was no trouble at all when I wanted to check the bill to pay it without having the birthday gal seeing the bill. His ability to work with me and be effectient and professional and engaging was appreciated.

When we went, with my partner we asked the staff if they can make changes to our meal due to dietary requirement and it was possible.

Waiting time was reasonable for the food to arrive.

And if one needs to relief themselves there is a lavatory facility available in the basement level. And let me tell you, it's a very fancy lavatory.

I will admit it was Paddy’s day however the aggression I observed by one particular waiter was atrocious. He treated the younger staff terribly and almost caused an accident whilst impatiently grabbing customer’s dishes and shoving them on their tables.

I don’t mind spending money on food however I do not appreciate being lied to either. Everyone surrounding us were eating this beautiful stacked burger. I asked for it and was told “it was part of the kids menu” - no child could possibly finish this burger which was most certainly an adults dish.

We waited 25 minutes of trying to catch staff’s eyes to take our order and when we finally called someone they were quite unfriendly. Our food arrived well before our drinks and when we ordered a jug of Sangria it took 20 minutes and a prompt to staff from us before it arrived. We had already finished our food! The food was a mix of good and poor. The chorizo in particular tasted very cheap but the calamari was lovely. I believe that adding a mandatory 12.5% tip to every bill has left no reason for the staff to offer good service and is really letting the restaurant down. It was not particularly busy and the staff were standing around a lot. The music was also very loud and we found it he’d to hear each other.

Thank you for sharing your experience at the Market Bar restaurant. I'm sorry to hear that your visit did not meet your expectations, and that you had some issues with the food and the wait time.

I understand your hesitation to return to the restaurant, but I hope that the Market Bar can address the issues you've mentioned and improve the quality of their food and service in the future.

This place only gets two stars for the fact the staff were nice and the atmosphere is nice in the restaurant, but the food is awful. We ordered off the dinner menu and got the chicken skewers, nachos, patatas bravas and the bread to start. The bread was stale and the dip it came with was flavorless. The patatas bravas were soggy flavorless potatoes with some kind of cold tomatoe sauce and some other white sauce on top of them. They tasted of nothing but wet spuds. The nachos were mediocre at best. The cheese tasted so artificial and it was bright orange and the nachos were all soggy. The chicken came out barely cooked and with no seasoning on it, just grilled chicken and some yellow sauce that was apparently “saffron aioli” that tasted like mustard. Overall I hated the food and the fact a 12.5% service charge is charged on every table doesn’t make me want to like this restaurant any more. Wouldn’t recommend for food, Okay place for drinks however the drinks are more expensive than most places. A pint of Guinness was 7€. Save your money.",,,"HI Ailis,

Besides the drinks we drank, we had no options whatsoever. Due to the Group Menu, we felt like in school where you have to eat the meal of the day.

And the best we got from the staff was a very condescending comment from the manager saying ""you received an email with all the conditions"". Honestly, as a constructive feedback, it is not reasonable to think that a group of 12 people will happily take a compulsory menu just because someone tells you that ""everything was explained in an email"". Especially if there is just one person out of the 12 who received the email.

Very rigid experience with just alright food.",,,"Hi Javier, 
Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at the Market Bar.  I'm sorry to hear that your experience was not satisfactory. It is important to us that all of our customers feel valued and have an enjoyable experience. 
We understand that having limited options and a compulsory menu can be frustrating, especially when dining with a group but to serve large groups we need to have a limited menu so our kitchen doesn't get overwhelmed and we apologise for the inconvenience that this may have caused.

Booked well in advance for a table of 6 people for a special anniversary meal. Arrived on time at 8pm, shown to our table right at the door, beside where the waitress greets customers so asked if we could move as we saw a large table free towards the back. They told us to sit and wait & then eventually moved us. Our starters didn’t arrive to 9pm. And main courses 10.10pm. The mains arrived with a burnt burger bun, cold chips and cold veg. Asked if they could be reheated & they did come back out fresh & fairly quickly. But the whole night to be honest was a shambles. No waitresses around to ask for things, no one came to ask for extra drinks/ to see if all was ok. I understand on a Saturday night they are busy but have more staff on or else don’t accept a large table at 8pm.

Our waiter William was fantastic! He was so attentive and personable, so much so that we specifically asked for him the second time.
He also gave us a list of towns to visit on our next trip to Italy. He went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations!
Each visit we then sat at the bar for a few night caps after dinner. The bartenders were the best in Dublin!
Very professional, entertaining, and we were impressed by the precision of their work, like a fine oiled machine. Hats off to the Bar Manager, he also engaged in conversation with us.
The food was delicious, especially the mango & lime chicken wing appetizer. Best wings ever! I ordered them on both visits.
The Restaurant Manager (the gentleman with the beard) was so friendly and helpful, he answered all our questions.
Thank you to everyone at The Church for making our nights special!

The food was delicious! They had a variety of vegetarian options and their vegan fried rice was an absolute delicacy. The cocktails were refreshing and beautifully presented. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals.

The bar area was also great with live Irish music playing throughout. We even got to see some tap dance which was an added bonus. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, making our dining experience even better.

From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with the warmth of the cloakroom service, which set the tone for the evening. Our table for two at the bar was the perfect vantage point to witness the masterful cocktail-making skills of the bartender. It was truly a work of art, and we were in awe.

The Tuna Tartar starter was elegantly presented and tasted even better than it looked. We paired it with a superb French Sauvignon bottle that complemented the dish impeccably. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive, making the dining experience even more memorable.

For our main courses, my partner opted for the Mussels with Creme White Wine Sauce, which was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. Meanwhile, I savoured the Fish and Chips, which were generous in portion size and cooked to perfection. The flavours were exquisite, and I was thoroughly impressed with my meal.

The dessert selection was just as impressive as the rest of the menu, with a mouth-watering selection of ice creams, including vanilla baileys and pistachio. The kitchen staff went above and beyond by adding a special birthday message for my partner, complete with a candle and a baby meringue. It was a lovely touch that made the evening even more special.

The atmosphere in the restaurant was buzzing, and the manager's attention to detail and professionalism was exemplary.

Restaurant was pretty full, and unfortunately that meant you were quite tightly packed in to your tables, so it felt a little bit like you were eating with another couple.  The food was fairly good. The dishes came with plenty of seafood, which all tasted nice.

Service let them down on this evening though. We were welcomed nicely at the front door, and taken straight to our seats.  The service from then was pretty average, certainly not the level you expect for the price you pay.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which never arrived, and at no point were we asked if we wanted anymore drinks. During the meal no one checked in to see if everything was okay, and despite my wife being clear about her allergies, she still had a very minor allergic reaction to the starter (nothing a benadryl couldn't sort straight away).

Martin our server was so friendly and attentive.

I simply can not choose a favourite dish as every single one was incredible. We had the following for two and in short it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time:

Crab claws (so sweet, simple and comforting)
6 Oysters (Achill and Connemara were particularly amazing)
Scallops (unreal)

Lobster Thermador (absolute must. Our first time having a full lobster and it was everything we hoped for. 85e and worth every penny)
Monkfish (so meaty it was glorious and the arancini was out of this world)
Side of fries

Lemon tart (stunning)
Deconstructed pavlova

Glass of wine (NZ Sauvignon ☆☆☆☆☆)
Glass of beer
Tea (how come the tea was also 5 stars?!)

In total with tip our bill came to 230e which for the quality, quantity, atmosphere, service and all round taste sensation was fantastic value for money.

We cannot wait to return and I have not stopped recommending to people! Thank you!

We sat close to the bar on tall stools which was fine as it gave us a good view, however, it would’ve been nice to sit at a normal table as opposed to in an elevated position.

Our waiter was obsessed with us, providing a review and including his name on there, as I’m not sure whether they get paid for positive reviews on Google which would make sense. Due to his obsessive behaviour, however, it feels inappropriate to do that.

Three of the five of us arrived early so just sat outside enjoying the neighborhood. About 20 minutes passed and a host came out. We told her we were just waiting till our friends arrived. She asked if we would like to see a drink menu and we agreed. She never brought it out. When our other two friends arrived I went it to ask if we could be seated even though we were about ten minutes early. The same host recognized me and must have realized we were still outside waiting for drink menus. I told her we were all here. We were seated. Joe was our server. Two of us ordered martinis. I asked for an Absolute Martini straight up with three olives. My friend asked for a dirty martini. The drinks were awful - far too much vermouth. My friend said she couldn’t even taste the vodka because there was so much vermouth. We decided not to complain at the moment but would alert Joe after that the martinis were made wrong - not wanting our money back but just to be helpful. Joe said that “in Ireland martinis are made with a 1:1 ratio of vermouth to vodka.”  We all at the table thought that was odd but since this was our first time in Ireland we didn’t pursue it. Later when we got back to our hotel we asked the bartender there how martinis were made in Ireland because we were told at a restaurant that they were made differently than in the US. The bartender seemed puzzled but told us martinis in Ireland are made just like the US - shot of vodka and just a tiny splash of vermouth. We don’t like being told a tale by Joe, the waiter. Maybe he thought that he was telling the truth but an apology for not liking the drinks would have been nice.

We headed over here after having to make reservations; after our arrival we could see why the place is so popular. Service is very attentive, and the atmosphere is great! Love the nautical-themed bar/seating area.

I was not too hungry so I ordered only appetizers; the shared prawn cocktail along with fish stew was plenty. The Husband had seared mackerel as an appetizer and said it's the best he's ever had.

The deliciousness of the food is reflected in the prices, but it's not overdone; our bill for four people was €240, and this included a few glasses of wine and liquor.

When the table next to us left the staff proceeded to get ready for a table of eight. There was lots of moving tables, dragging chairs and general noise setting up. This could have been done with minimum fuss but unfortunately it wasn’t.

We ordered sparkling water and a bottle of Cloudy Bay and then our food. At this level and prices you expect everything to be faultless. We had crab claws and a quinoa salad to start, both were delicious. Our mains off salmon and fillet steak arrived but no veg or garlic butter for the steak. Also the steak was extremely undercooked. The fries were not as described on the menu (string cut) but were actually I think frozen. I called over a manager and my steak went back. This is where Bogdan took over looking after us and he was a star. The steak arrived back cooked perfectly however still no veg or butter. I had to ask for these and then eventually ordered pepper sauce. The pepper sauce was terrible and the veg was cold and tasteless. Overall the temperature of all our food was questionable. We ordered cheesecake and a cheese board for dessert. The cheese board was amazing.

As mentioned Bogdan is a real star and without his intervention our meal would have been a total disaster. He really rescued the night. A real nice guy.

Restaunts at this level charging these prices need to have impeccable service and food. The highlight of the night was the wine.

Staff was super friendly, engaged a lot in the wine choice which was appreciated. Inconsistencies in terms of presenting the food - we chose the tasting menu but some waiters neglected to present what it was we were served (without the menu at hand we had no way of knowing everything but what we could visually tell).

Food was really nice. Good, honest food with amazing produce. The only remark here was that they served the food too hot to eat so we had to wait a weirdly long amount of time before eating sometimes (champagne problem though). We were super happy with all of the courses apart from the dessert, where everything was really yummy and flavorful, but the meringue was not well baked - the bottom of it was like chewing gum.

I ordered the scallops and the sea bass fillet in Thai style curry sauce.

The scallops had a lovely texture though it could have used a bit more seasoning and could have been seared a bit more (there are some representative images posted by others here). Nevertheless, the scallops were still delicious, but not as delicious as it could potentially be!

The sea bass was superb. It was perfectly seasoned and the skin had a lovely, crispy texture. The flavours of the Thai style curry sauce had a rich, spiced, coconut flavour that went well with the umami of the fish. Splendid meal!

We ate here on our first night and were so impressed that we had breakfast and lunch there everyday. The restaurant is pretty small and can get pretty full in the evening but it is really cute with all of its traditional irish decorations. Then there is the service, to be honest it was pretty bland and subdued in the morning but maybe that suits most after a night on the guiness. It was still efficient but nothing special. But in the evening it was great, very friendly and professional. They even sang happy birthday on my birthday and stuck a candle in my cheesecake.
Now, the food, just perfect! During our stay, I think we tried most items on the menu. The irish breakfast with crispy bacon and black and white pudding was a great way to start the day before a day of walking about. Then  all the traditionals were spot on too: both the irish stews, the chowder, fish and chips, amd the lamb shank was so tender.

We are traveling with twin toddlers and had spent the day touring Dublin. We wanted to eat dinner in the Temple Bar neighborhood before calling it a day. The twins were not in the best of mood and kid friendly in America seems a bit different than kid friendly in Dublin. Lots of small restaurants and not much room for buggies and toddlers. First two restaurants we tried were just not good. My wife found The Old Mill, it was near our car in Fleet Street and I figured, worth a shot. We got the restaurant and a staff member on the street gave us a menu. Then I noticed the stairs. I try and be very respectful of staff and other patrons. Bringing cranky kids into place of business can be tough. Lugging the days stuff upstairs was daunting. The hostess insisted we would be fine and we would just need to fold down one of the buggies. She had staff help us up with our stuff and they got us seated. The Old Mill was about half-full. The waiter came and got our food and drink orders. The staff paid lots of attention to the boys and generally kept us all entertained while the establishment filled up. Our food came out (kids meals, my wife got their lamb, and I got the two course special, simple burger and garlic bread). The meals were terrific. The twins had their first fish and chips and loved them. My burger was juicy and the large strips of bacon added salty, fatty amazingness. The brown gravy was a wonderful touch on the side. My wife's lamb was perfect. Juicy and falling off the bone. To be completely honest the staff was so amazing, the food could have been inedible and I would still rate highly. But the food was sooooo good. On our way out the manager helped me carry our louds to the street, we chatted for a few minutes, and I felt as if I parted dinner at a distant relatives home.

I am a very critic person and always consider all aspects of a restaurant when giving a review, so read the below and you will definitely book a table in “las tapas de Lola” soon.
1) fast booking on the phone.
2) professional service. Waitress was native from Spain, knew the best tapas to recommend, and always spoke with patience and a smile on her face.
3) environment: well distributed tables, all tidy and clean. Even toilet was small but pristine clean and with soft scented sticks.
4) THE FOOD: we ordered olives, croquetas, gambas, octopus and pork. Octopus goes definitely at the top of my list. I have never eaten such a soft and tasty octopus on top of potato slices! The jam croquetas were made by God’s hands. I am not joking. The olives’ oil was at the exact spicy level, and they came with valencian almonds! The pork could be divided by only pressing with the fork. For dessert we got cheese cake. WOW, so smooth, with soft vanilla flavor, without dough at the bottom.
Overall, the best food experience in more than 4 years.

Randomly found this place while visiting Dublin without any expectations. Unfortunately the whole thing started on the wrong foot because we just walked in without waiting to be seated and the waiter had to educate us (stupid tourists) that in Ireland you must wait to be seated at a restaurant.

Prawn dish was the standout, but all excellent. Finished by sharing the churros and a coffee. Great food and great buzz in the place. Really feels like being in Spain. Tried a glass of both the red and white sangria, just to round out the tapas experience, but reverted to beer for my final drink. The only slight negative was the service.

I can honestly say this is the best Spanish restaurant in Dublin BY FAR! The quality of the food is outstanding, it is quite clear that the Chef is Spanish or at least has absorbed amazingly the Spanish culinary culture.

The entrance is reminiscent of Soho House in Chicago, and a quick lift ride up to the 5th floor you’re greeted with swings for a photo op. Then walk into the lovely dining space. We were lucky it was a clear day and could see lovely views of the city in a quiet, refined environment. The service was friendly, and I ordered the vegetarian Benedict, which was cooked to perfection. This is a wonderful spot to slow down, warm up, and enjoy the views with great company.

Lovely views over the Dublin rooftops with the sun shining through.

Service was smashing without being overbearing!

Steak was cooked as ordered, lacked a little seasoning. Greens were extra but worth it as cooked fresh, not microwaved or reheated - this drives me nuts and a lot of high end places still do it!!

Chicken with Nduja sauce and Orecchiette pasta was superb - I’m going back for this. Pasta Al dente, sauce rich but not sickening. Small piece of chicken - but enough for me.

Cocktails and soft drinks priced high, but not unusual for Dublin or type of setting.

Looking forward to a repeat visit, maybe to see the sun set or check out the outside area … car parking 5 mins walk at Stephen’s green.

Older kids loved the pizza and skinny chips - fresh dough",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK16ZVr3l7TO-XHEjKMYhMUg5dNuNRurAzmJ4J,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK16ZVr3l7TO-XHEjKMYhMUg5dNuNRurAzmJ4J, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMi8sUrp6UbS3ZaD8iApFxa3BTI-4S-XjCFKRTF","Hi there,

I had the pancakes and was pleasantly surprised by the large bottle of maple syrup meaning I could have as much as I liked! They even went out of their way to give our friend a plate with icecream  rasperries and chocolate crumble as well as happy birthday written on it using choclate.

We read about Winding Stair in a few lists and our friend Tara who used to live in Dublin recommended this place. This place was PERFECT! We got a great seat on the top floor on the corner with a  view of the Ha'penny bridge and all the machinations of Temple Bar across the river. The service was perfect and the food, presentation, ingredients was divine. The wine list was also expansive, I would say our only minor complaint was that some of the dishes came over sauced. My scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny center, crispy sausage wrapping, served piping hot but was sitting on a bed of some sort of aoli or mayo based sauce which I wished was on the side so it didn't mess up my perfect egg. My gnudi also had a really thick sauce. I wish I had ordered the Cod which our friend ordered which came with a generous side of lightly prepared veggies. The Cod was a giant slab, crispy on one side and perfectly flaky all the way through. Difficult to do with such a big piece of fish. The pork chop which my brother in law ordered was also a generous piece of meat and tasted divine. My husband ordered the tongue appetizer. So good! But once again we had to scrape off the dollop of mayo. Now that I've been there once we would know what to order and maybe the chef would be amenable to a request for light sauce. I guess I wouldn't ask for it on the side because the presentation is beautiful, but to our taste, less is more especially when you're working with such talented cooking and great ingredients. The interior design of this place feels like the  interior of your tasteful aunt's place. Old book shelves artfully placed, gorgeous old floors, love the tables and chairs and of course all the windows and light. If I lived in Dublin I would eat here once a week. (Though a tiny bit pricey, most things are big enough to share). Oh and before I forget, the cheesecake!

Ordered 2 porterhouses, supposed to be their best, ordered medium rare and came out rare on one and was well done on the ends for the other.

Would not recommend and try other places if you want to try Irish beef.
Waiter was excellent and the drinks were well made.
Sides were pretty good and we liked the starters

I wasn't sure if we would have enough time to start with a drink in the bar but there is no rush at all the staff make you feel at home. The bar is small but it's not why you visit, it's perfect sized as they move you to your table and it's not overcrowded. The range of whiskeys and cocktails is unbelievable and I would definitely recommend starting with one. When the food starts the flavours and presentation is incredible all the way to the last bite. They showed us around the place as it was our first time to visit. The building itself is remarkable with the chefs table in the kitchen and the Midleton room for private dining.

I visited Chapter One in August with a friend. I was prepared to blow my budget, I just knew it was gonna be pricey.

But, all I can say is that, if you love food, and appreciate the art that food can be, it was,and is, worth every penny.

We went for the tasting menu and wine pairing because why the hell not. Its not an experience you can do every day.

To say our minds were blown and tastebuds truly satisfied would be an understatement.

Wines were paired perfectly, the staff were attentive and funny, not overly stuffy which you may expect from such a fine place. And the food! Well the lobster dish was top class, it came with this insane lobster bisque and risotto...insane. we also got 3 desserts and the lavender ice cream with crystallised fennel was so unique and surprisingly delish.

I could go on but I won't. If you have a good budget, go here for a celebration or go here if you appreciate amazing fine food and excellent service.

Overall, the experience was positive. The atmosphere was cozy and it was the first time I'd experienced very talkative serving staff and clientele.  Obviously Chapter One has a number of regulars who all like to converse and did not strike me and my wife as a Michelin starred restaurant.

This feeling was however short lived as we too got into the fun and conversed with the locals who gave us great tips on places to see and restaurants to try.

Now, onto the food.  We went with the 5-course tasting menu.  Presentation was fine however,  the mushroom risotto was a bit on the salty side.  The wine pairing were quite complementary to the dish.

However the food (although well presented) was a big let down and extremely overpriced for the quality.

My starter was Irish pudding which was essentially a large liver/lamb/blood sausage in bread crumbs. Big, dry and un-appetizing.

The mains were bad, my partner got the sesame pork belly and scallop which resulted in a large block of pork fat and a fishy tasting/smelly scallop, unappetising, who would want to eat a large block of pure fat!? Only had a sliver of actual pork meat.

I got a massive, tough piece of steak which was a chore to get through as there was nothing special to the meat although it was cooked well. With a sort of pickled ginger on top which did nothing for the steak.
The potatoes were great, though, probably the best dish of the entire meal.

My dessert was a 'cake' with ice cream. Same quality as a chocolate muffin and ice cream in a  Supermacs.

Altogether, 65e for those 3 courses per person. Should be max 40e for the quality of food. Felt disappointed and ripped off.

The servers were very quick and attentive in seating us. The restaurant itself is very small and only seats roughly 20 diners (9 small tables and 2 bar seats) at a time, which is why you only have your table for 2 hours for quick turnover.

The 3 course fixed menu has a decent variety, you have a choice of 3 starters, 3 mains and 3 desserts. Note there is no al a carte option. To accompany our meal, we ordered a bottle of Merlot.

We ordered the housemade goats cheese, fig, tomato starter (which was served on an interesting glass plate) and smoked haddock with prawn reduction. For main course we had the crispy pork belly with a rich truffle risotto and beef fillet en croute, which came with a potato crisp and brie mushroom sauce. We were surprised with the large portions of meat in this course.

I had the chicken wing with beef for starter. Very rich, hearty dish. The standout for the starters was the pate with beetroot jam.
For the main I chose the beef wellington as a friend is somewhat of a wellington aficionado. It didn't disappoint.
My partner had the cod which received no complaints.
Wine list was a little short but we chose a delicious bottle which hit the spot.
It was not overly busy on the night but service was still very good. We were never rushed and plates were cleared appropriately. Price was very reasonable.
Another bonus is the restaurant is right next door to arguably the best pint of Guinness in Dublin. (Mulligan's)

Small place with attentive service and kitchen in the rear.

Started with Guinness bread with fennel butter. The menu changes and we were lucky enough to have the Cajun chowder which was like a gumbo with a lot more fish, to start with a gluten-free prawn risotto with fresh parsley, cheese and tomatoes. Very flavorful and creamy risotto.

Limited wine menu, although the Tempranillo was a delight.

On another note the owner Sean nicely squeezed in our party of three. A d we enjoyed his varied Spotify playlist.

It came with some puff bread, a starter, a main, and dessert. For our starters, the three of us had the vintage kitchen Cajun stew, the prawn red pepper chili risotto, and our third friend is vegetarian so she asked for the prawn risotto without the prawn and they offered to make her a special vegetarian risotto which was incredible! The prawn risotto was delicious and I still think about it. There was an abundance of prawn in it that I had prawn in every bite.

Our mains were the pork shoulder wrapped in chicken skin with truffle gnocchi and the acorn squash. They paled in comparison to our starters. For dessert, we tried the cheese board, the chocolate lava cake with ice cream, and the set caramel with limoncello. Wouldn’t say the cheese board or the chocolate lava cake were anything special but the set caramel with limoncello was unique and tasty! A great mix of flavors.

Overall would recommend coming here for sure and 35€ was a good deal for the quality and amount of food we got.

We later came to realize that the staff had served her fish and chips with malt vinegar and weren’t provided with a fresh meal but instead told that “there will be very little gluten”. My girlfriend ended up having an allergic reaction later that night that could only be described as “the worst she’s ever had” which leads me to believe that the fish and chips she was served not actually gluten free but rather a normal fish and chips.

The Ober was asking 3 times if we want to order but where looking at the menu. It was very rushed. The vegan burger was terrific and the fish and chips was tasteless/flavorless. We had ordered a nice bottle of wine but after 1.5 hour we are unkindly asked to leave but the wine was not finished yet. We get the receive unasked and the there was a voluntary tip calculated on the receive. When we asked to pay by card the Ober typed in the price inclusive the tip and we said he need to change it.

To find a place that meets all of our dietary needs is difficult. Millstone not only met our requirements but far surpassed our expectations.

My fillet was so beautiful it was almost a religious experience. A new religion could be founded on the flavour that exploded in my mouth. It was the purest meat enhanced by a perfect blend of simple spices that never overpowered the meat's natural taste. The sauce made the cut pop, without hiding the true essence of the steak.

My husband's vegan tofu steak was beautifully crafted by someone who knows vegan cuisine and did not try to recreate a meat dish. My daughter's lamb shank was tender, falling off the bone, and perfectly matched with the sauce enhancing all of the subtle flavours of the meat.

The food is average. The salmon was overcooked and dry, the green beans were flavourless, and the mash potatoes that came with it lacked everything, tasteless. The steak is OK. The fish and chips were the best course for sure. What saved the meal was the crème brûlée and the chocolate mousse, which were absolutely delicious. They do have a children's menu, which is good.

Food was delicious and service was fast. Could not fault anything hence the 5 star. Chicken wings were fried but without the thick breadcrumbs that you often see in restaurants. We appreciated the fact that they agreed to put the sauce on the side. The buffalo sauce was incredible - I don’t usually like it (hence the sauce on the side) but this sauce was not too sour and it was creamy. Calamari was huge too

Both the salmon and the beef were cooked perfectly.

I didn’t feel like an inconvenience like I have been made to feel In restaurants at home. She was polite and welcoming, as were all other people we were served by. The food was amazing, one of the best meals we had our whole trip. I would definitely visit again if I were to travel back to Dublin.",,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoX2M2WVlnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x99ed24939d837725!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICh_c6YYg%7CCgsI4d3NnwYQ4PXoLg%7C?hl=en-US,5,1676898017,02/20/2023 13:00:17,0,-7.35518E+18

Loved the atmosphere at Luigi’s but unfortunately, the place seemed understaffed at the time and as a consequence, the service wasn’t as quick. Also, it can be hard to get the attention of members of the waiting team.

For dinner, I ordered their vegan pizza which was decent but what I was delighted was were the textures of the pizza, which were similar to that of non-vegan pizza. Reasonably priced gin and tonic too (for Temple Bar anyway). Based on feedback from other members of the group, the food was cheap but the quality was OK.

It’s not amazing but it’s not bad either. It’s just okay and because of that it’s disappointing becase you can’t complain to them about the food but you can’t also just say hey I just wanted to tell you your food is just mediocre. So I’m very upset because we wanted to visit for a while but ultimately the food arrived just medium warm (hot in some places) and on my Burrata pasta I only had a tiny little piece of Burrata on it.

We were sat at a table with little to no light so it was dark and gloomy.

The service was slow we were waiting for 20 minutes for someone to ask if we even wanted drinks. Asked for water to the table along with cocktails and this didn’t arrive and we had to ask the waiter again to bring water.

Food service was slow with Mozzarella missing from Bruschetta which is a €2 extra. We had to wait 10 minutes to get the mozzarella before we could start eating together.

After starters plates were cleared and it was 30 minutes before we got main courses with no staff checking in or explaining anything to us. We had to ask staff again for an update on when the main courses would arrive.

We were given a free round of cocktails for the delays however this does not make up for bad service. This was appreciated but bad service outweighs anything else in a restaurant.

We won’t be returning and think they should look at improving service a lot - staff seem to hide away from the dining room in a little private service corner.

€75 for really bad service with no communication. We can understand if a place was extremely busy there would be delays but the restaurant wasn’t that full and there wasn’t any communication about delays etc etc.

Please improve service as the food was great but the consistent need to try get a staff members attention made the experience one of the worst we have had.",,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4c3RLcjhRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe32018733020de3f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICxstKr8QE%7CCgwIwrqDowYQ6IKTjQM%7C?hl=en-US,1,1684069698,05/14/2023 13:08:18,0,-2.08064E+18

I’m surprised we got a reservation during this time. Regardless, it was my dearest friends birthday, and during this national holiday, I asked for the manager or someone in at least a manager position to give us a birthday/holiday deal, any sort of surprise or excitement that would catch everyone off guard. My dear friend is named Patrick, he was born on st. Patricks day, turning 21, we are American and here to celebrate his specific day, and the manager made sure that it was personal. He looked me in the eye, asked what this person looked like, asked what kind of surprise we could give him…

Long story short, we have him a birthday we won’t ever forget in Dublin, Ireland. He surprised my dear friend Pat with free shot of whisky, gave him a hug from behind, and even had the staff sing with him. This place has only exceeded expectations, not only on top of food and taste, but personality and pleasure. I 100% recommend coming to this restaurant in the heart of Dublin, as the employees will make you feel like you are valued. Yeah, the food was good, but it’s so much more. Have a good time, send well wishes to the manager, and happy st. Patrick’s day.

Very nice place, very good food, outdoor seating, very nice and peaceful location when compared to city.
We ordered
vegetarian lasagna: tasty and yum, decent portion;
vegetarian pizza: thin crust, lots of vegetables, served warm;
long island iced tea: the best I have ever had, this was the highlight of the dinner;
nachos and cauliflower on the sides: very very tasty, must order from appetizers, served hot, big portions; and
my friends ordered milk shakes and some juices: they liked it.
Service by the new trainee Anne Marie: top of the order, good to speak to, food served hot in no time, calm composed courteous soft spoken.
Overall, it was a nice dinner and experience, would love to come back again. 5 stars for them
1 star deducted on the account of Manager( i think her name is Paulina). We asked for student discounts and her manager said
1. We dont do student discounts: fair enough;
2. You guys don't look like students: found that bit rude or not a good quality  joke. But then I showed my Student id card to them. Thats why deducted 1 star.

The staff were extremely friendly and the service was flawless. Drinks were spot on, and the atmosphere was great! (We ate yesterday evening, a Saturday).

My only issue was that the steak I ordered as rare appeared to only have been cooked for 20 seconds a side, and was barely warm in the middle. Sure, I did order a steak at an Italian restaurant, sure I did order it rare, and sure I could have asked for it to be taken back and re done. However, I didn’t want to cause a fuss (I take full responsibility for this), and the steak actually tasted really nice! I had the garlic butter with it and the skinny fries were great too.

I will attach a photo of said steak, and perhaps it could be a lesson to future customers not to order a rare steak, and also maybe the chef just to double check the temperature!

We had to sit outside because some people in our group weren’t fully vaccinated, but there’s was almost zero lighting outside. It was pretty dark and we could barely see each other. They have us little table lights but I do think they could try get some better lights.

Really nice restaurant at a good location close to the temple bar area.
The staff was super nice and helpful and we did not needed a reservation.
God the bbq pork ribs .. super good seasoning and not dry. The sauce to sweet for my liking and to store like, but that's personal preference.
That pork lasagna was a hit .. very unique and tasted like pulled pork roast.. super good.
Cocktails were ok, nothing fancy.

As a group of 6, celebrating a birthday, the service we experienced in this restaurant was appalling.
From the time we sat down, it took over 1 to receive our starters, and a second hour after that to receive our mains. At no point within this time frame did anyone come to take a drinks order, meaning we were left waiting on food and drinks for the majority of our time.
After the starters, fresh cutlery was not provided, meaning we had to request fresh cutlery for the mains we assumed would be out within a reasonable timeframe of 25-30 minutes.
This is of no reflection of our lovely server, who clearly looked over worked in an understaffed environment. This is a great reflection on the management as when we complained, he tried to argue that we were “only” waiting 40 minutes for our mains, when it was in fact an hour at that point. At that, the mains arrived at once and left one person without their main for a further 10 minutes whilst everyone else was eating.
To add to our frustration, the food arrived almost cold, but due to the fact it was now 22:30pm, we ate and decided to leave.
Myself and 5 others would not be returning, especially as a group.

As another reviewer mentioned it's for the tourists, and I think I would agree.
You have the classic 4 options.
Pizza
Pasta
Burgers
Chef special

The pizza was really good, needed a little more seasoning in the tomato base.
Stone fired which is the ONLY way. I didn't try a menu item, I customised my pizza. Crunch thim base pizza. Yummy.
The lasagna was also pretty good, the portions are a tad smaller than you would expect, so try a starter. The buffalo wings are a good bet, but a little pricey for 16 small winglets.
Atmosphere reminds me of a Madrid restaurant style. Lots of folks enjoying meals with us, so it's a popular venue. We were able to get a table in arrival.
I think the best tables are in the lower section which is cosy and more loungy in atmosphere. Service was ok. Would have been nice to have a special of the day, if there was the server didn't call it out to us.

They cater to vegan palettes.",,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURobWEyVUNnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe32018733020de3f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhma2UCg%7CCgsI0Mi3oAYQqJzvMw%7C?hl=en-US,5,1678632016,03/12/2023 14:40,2,-2.08064E+18

Food is average and edible. The chicken boxty was decent and the lamb stew was average. The baileys cheesecake was very sour and was not flavourful.
Service is poor -
On observation, except for the senior servers, the rest are just plain ignorant and some extremely rude.
Snatching away drinks at the exit when one of your servers said its okay to do so, is NOT OKAY. Not to mention, I asked for a to-go cup and I was told you guys don't have one. It could have been said in a polite way as we had just paid for the dinner. Instead of saying ' thank you for visiting us', that's how they treat their customers once they have gotten their money.

One of the episodes was in Dublin, and I didn't think I would ever make it to Ireland. So when the opportunity came up, we prioritized going to this restaurant highly recommended by Phil Rosenthal.

My father-in-law, husband, and I made dinner reservations at 9:30 pm after their round of golf at Portmarnock. The food was delicious, as advertised.

What we ate:

✅ Boxty Sharing Platter

✅ Gallagher’s Lamb Stew

✅ Beef & Stout Stew

✅ Traditional Irish Corned Beef

✅ Sticky Toffee Pudding

As for the dessert I had bread and butter pudding, and Boxty bread ice cream. For the drinks I only had the non alcoholic drinks the blueberry mojito, homemade sweet lemonade and homemade ice tea they were nice but my favorite was virgin sour!
I had virgin marry but I don’t recommend it because it tasted like tomato soup with ice, but I like to try new things it’s fun, so if you are brave to try new things then go ahead and try it.

I am still wondering why they did not switch on the air conditioning.

Food wise, I didn't choose well, don't go for the chowder or the fish and chips. Chowder is tasteless and for the first time in my life I had to add salt to it. I have no idea how you can find seafood as bad, but somehow they managed to do so. Fish and chips are not good, with a super tick bread on the fish, and way too oily. The salmon looks good, so go for it if you have the chance.

Desserts were the best, and still I wouldn't go for them.

Service was nice but slow and overwhelmed. With the money they charge for the food, I was expecting way better and faster service. We had to request several times for water, and napkins. Not great, but still their effort is appreciated because it's not their fault.

The bathrooms... Well, judge for yourself, but basically I had to go to another place because they are basically dirty.

In short, a place a won't visit again; overpriced to the extreme and with lack of staff.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq-0iHejaOKOLklvArEPIHUksyZa0hJ4zQJTYU,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq-0iHejaOKOLklvArEPIHUksyZa0hJ4zQJTYU, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTi15SAWWpZpG9VOhK_tSPn0fbPNHPm_jMMUNs, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2MSV1A3d60lSjGy4FgKMcIdIGhrcOoCDjg4n-, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlGRqJpTN_OMg0Un6na5wnkKpDaAHanclfzJ9B, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSrAecD5fwUEyo0n7EobDYECsRJJT5b7txJTUd, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBIx8tl4MHrJPQ3t4nBvASXuFD2piMNI_pNrW_, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuK_QkcdhvTlw39nFGxxb__NnXQV_cNihDt1gg, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_bjc2RG4lJBKjPzhPCnZg9XD_c2QxRFad7YGb, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ82qoRmm2dka2PEo5iXNO5eG9b9ly4OLS2i4m, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYg3a0LxpqvaXAZ-TMon-f8kPcJQgFw5OSK6Bm, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5jHHYVKG-c9_v6DElAAVmfcvQGmy-cmcmeFFB, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhfpqnKt6uyzSE8k29TMj__av8nCEnP4CE5pea",,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURld01LVlNBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x110b1df99a694a64!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDewMKVSA%7CCgwIx8vSmQYQ-K37igM%7C?hl=en-US,2,1664394695,09/28/2022 19:51:35,4,1.22811E+18

Located at the basement of a red-brick terrace house. There were 2 doors, one for entry and the other for exit, which I obviously do not follow. The interior was charming.

Service
The host was nice and friendly. We were explained the menu and was attended attentively.

Food
The food was superb. I enjoyed the bread and entree to the dessert.

Overall
A must visit if you are in town.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqezqQiIGyZlLz92jTDBA4DWwSZ-c1DU4oCPeA,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqezqQiIGyZlLz92jTDBA4DWwSZ-c1DU4oCPeA, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHuTjGWHUGeVzWUUiADmDYxWiL4HLCD1GyP00b, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFsVezyl7hWh6Ac6_VziVUMDwQQEgiE6z2-ZDR, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxrBIPymqfFIr4hkCQ7jWyWhNrSk14B2-cc6GF, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjaKrMMhx-txGWiBjxg3aR4Rzlv8LgJKnR9aeC, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZlArKRwVvn1jtXikr1qnvY_aXrKMSlIkzKl1x, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcNnPl6HQDS_57IGShEdgCaced4ZcM9aTaXXj6, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOs0T8HAZx0gD4TBmMMVw0uazCItGgMYXO6bGGm, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKV2NnrmJYNkFD-s1I28EsV70lZU6GDEHxl2cB, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPPbYvqjs5du-z1AgA1tLcJ-fgBIkigMmmyTdu, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFLlp7gXqBWrZnLSi33fmayqaKPdeQnf8WejtC",,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCNnBha013EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x7ca49e7197727478!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDB6pakMw%7CCgsI_MaXngYQ2OW_Rw%7C?hl=en-US,5,1673913212,01/16/2023 23:53:32,0,8.98148E+18

The restaurant does a tasting menu and also offers a wine paring which we decided to do this time.

Honestly everything was fantastic. The food was delicious, the wine pairings were wonderful and well thought through and the staff were amazing!

We had a wonderful experience.

The menu changes regularly so if you want to revisit you will have a slightly different but still brilliant experience!

I recommend booking in advance as the restaurant is not walk in style.
The restaurant is perfect for a special occasion, to treat yourself or as an excuse to get a bit dressed up with some friends!

I got the premium wine pairing with my meal. Here are some notable and memorable highlights from my experience. To be noted- Their menu has since changed.

Ham hock - the perfect bite. Texture varied in every layer. Savory and creamy and smokey and salty and slightly sweet. Most delicious bite I've ever had.

Tuna tartare with chipotle tartlet- amazing fish quality. Never had tuna that tasted that fresh. Well seasoned. Perfectly spicy chipotle cream. Textures also on point with the thin crispy tartlet shell.

Scallops ""Waldorf""
Amazing tender scallops. Not fishy at all. The apple and cabbage and yellow (can't remember what it was) mousse were amazing. The walnuts were a perfect nutty addition that added a bit of sweetness and crunch that the dish truly benefited from.
Stunning presentation.

Cod and mussel- amazingly tender. Melt in your mouth. Most buttery tender mussels and cod literally melts when you chew. So good. The green curry sauce was a tad overpowering for the delicacy of the fish, but was still good flavor. Just left my mouth tingly and unable to really taste the fish. The squash with crispy seeds was a good addition. I always enjoy crispy grains and seeds on a plate with soft textures.

Duck and blackberry with cevennes(caramelized onion) and salsify-
Duck wasn't as tender as I expected. A tiny bit on the chewy side. The salsify- never had it before but absolutely loved it. Large portion for a main in a tasting menu. I was getting too full to finish because I wanted room for dessert so they gladly gave me a take away box to finish it later.
The blackberry and onion accompaniments were delightful and cut through the richness of the duck perfectly. Still wish the duck wasn't so chewy and hard to cut through but the flavor was delightful.

Lemon and rhubarb dessert was phenomenal and perfectly tart. The dessert wine pairing went perfectly with the flavor. Was a perfect intro to their sweet offerings.
The coconut and chocolate desserts weren't my jam but I'm not a huge fan of either flavor. However the coconut ice cream between dehydrated chocolate mousse wafers was great and I'd definitely eat that again.

The passion fruit jelly with passion mousse was delightful. Perfect ending bite.

Ambiance was noisy. Conversations at every table were very overpowering. Definitely feels very casual vibe despite the menu and drinks.
Decor was minimal in a good way, a tad rustic and homey. Staff were very friendly and helpful but were less attentive than expected. Dirty plates/glasses sat on the table until right before the next course was served.

Overall delicious and good experience.

In fact, maybe Google might unlock a 6 star review option for special places. Mr Fox is certainly worthy of it.

So to start, can I say that I hate fish. I've never liked it. Or so I thought. I had 3 courses of fish. It wasn't forced but I really wanted to broaden my mind and really enjoy the Mr Fox experience. Suffice to say that I can see fish dishes being a feature of future posts and reviews.

From the moment we crossed the door until we climbed the stairs back up onto Parnell Square after our meal, the service was incredible. Not pushy or pretentious, just warm, friendly and attentive. The server spent plenty of time explaining the dishes that were coming.

I honestly couldn't fault anything. I've never been to a Michelin Star restaurant but can see Mr Fox featuring in the very near future. Our visit was a very special occasion and Mr Fox made it all the more special.

One main dish dish Halibut, and finished with duck which was so well cooked with perfect pink.

A few desserts followed by but some of them were way too heavy to finish off the meal. Would rather prefer something much less dairy based, and more a palate cleanser with citrus flavours etc.

Overall it's an excellent place to enjoy a nice meal! Good selection of champagne and wines by the glass, €65pp for food is a bargain in my opinion.

The staff is so attentive and friendly, the presentation of the dishes so carefully made and of course the food itself is delightful, so many delicious flavors. The home made bread should have it's own mention as it might be the most tasty, fresh bread I've had on the island, with an unbelievable butter.

My favorite course this month (November 2021 calendar) was the halibut. For dessert, even though I'm normally big into the citrus desserts, their clementine vanilla was heavenly! The beautiful champagne was a surprise gift from a fine gentleman to my friend for her birthday. He called reception and had to explain the situation because he doesn't know me and the table was under my name. Kudos to Natalia, our lovely server who found out about the plot!

They mostly got frantically removed seconds before the next dish. Not once were the cutlery put down in a proper way. Always very random.
We got the Fine Wines pairing but every single wine came in the same type of glass from the Cava to the Pinot Noir. Simply not good enough given the price.

The atmosphere is also very loud and hectic. Maybe because it was Saturday night however the acoustics were poor. We loved the food but service and atmosphere were lacking.
